# 51-android-rules __UBUNTU__
-------------------------------------


## _Intro_
_____________________________________


To create an easy-to-install version of _M0RF30's_ work which can be found [here](https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules.git). This installer should work on most linux distros but is focused on Ubuntu (try others at your own risk).

## _Installation_
_____________________________________


To install simply clone [this](https://github.com/lehmancurtis147/android-udev-rules.git) repository.

```bash
$cd ./android-udev-rules
```

followed by...

```bash
$chmod +x ./install.sh
```
and finally...

```bash
$sudo bash ./install.sh
```


##### _Extra_
______________________________________


Things seem to go smoother without having devices plugged in until after installation.

*Special thanks to M0RF30 for the original effort*
